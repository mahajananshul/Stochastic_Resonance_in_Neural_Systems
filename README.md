# Stochastic_Resonance_in_Neural_Systems
#Python based addition of two signals (subthreshold and noise to see effects on SNR)
It is often heard that noise degrades the original signal but noise enhancing the original signal is whatâ€™s appealing to many research scientists right now. Stochastic facilitation is a type of stochastic resonance which is believed to improve processing in theoretical models of neural science as well as experimental neuroscience. However, it is also important to see the basics of stochastic resonance before talking about stochastic facilitation framework. A simple approach to observe the detectability and SNR improvement by adding noise in signal is presented.
